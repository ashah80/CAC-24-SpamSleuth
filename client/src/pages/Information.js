          <p className="mb-4">
            Phishing is a type of online scam where attackers trick you into providing sensitive information, 
            like passwords or credit card numbers, by pretending to be a trustworthy entity, such as a bank or 
            a well-known website. They often send emails or messages that look legitimate, leading you to fake 
            websites designed to steal your data. Always double-check the source before clicking links or sharing 
            personal information.

          </div>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Spoofing occurs when someone disguises their identity to appear as someone else, often by 
            manipulating phone numbers or email addresses. For example, an email might look like it's 
            coming from a trusted contact or organization when it's actually from an attacker. Spoofing 
            is often used in phishing attempts to make them more convincing. Always verify unexpected messages 
            before acting on them.

          <p className="mb-4">
          Spam refers to unwanted, unsolicited messages, typically sent in bulk via email or text messages. 
          These messages often advertise products or services and can sometimes contain harmful links or 
          attachments. While spam is mostly annoying, it can also be dangerous, as some spam messages are 
          used to trick you into downloading malware or providing personal information. Itâ€™s best to avoid 
          clicking on links in spam messages and to use filters to reduce them.
